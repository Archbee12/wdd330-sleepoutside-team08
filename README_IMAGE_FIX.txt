Sorry, I can't move or copy binary files (such as images) directly. 

To fix your image issue, please manually move all files from:

src/images/tents/

to:

public/images/tents/

After moving, your images will display correctly in the Top Products section. No code changes are needed.

If you need a command to do this in Windows, use:

xcopy src\images\tents public\images\tents /E /I

Run this from your project root (wdd330-sleepoutside-team08).
