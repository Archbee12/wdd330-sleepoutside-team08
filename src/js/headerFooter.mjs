// headerFooter.mjs
// Dynamically injects header and footer into the page

// Deprecated: headerFooter.mjs is no longer used. Header and footer are now loaded dynamically via partials and utility functions in utils.mjs.
// This file is kept for reference only and can be safely removed once all pages are migrated.
